# DiabetesSolutions

This was a class course work to mine text data from GitHub.

We developed an android application that enables you to mine inform about diabetes solutions that exist on GitHub and stores this data in SQLite. The information collected is then used to map developers on a map so you can know where developer come from. 

We also used tensor flow to do some deep learning on collected data
